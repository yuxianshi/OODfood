This project aims to investigate approaches for processing images of food posted on restaurant review/booking websites or food delivery websites via image classification methods. Specifically, it would be useful to classify these images of food so that if customers are interested in trying the dishes they can use the images to better understand menu items before ordering. When classifying images, it is also important to know when a given image does not fit into one of the category values that the classifier is trained on, and which can be done by calculating a prediction score for how likely an image is to be out of distribution (OOD). In application, classifying images and predicting when images are OOD will help websites link items on a restaurant menu to photos of the corresponding dish, as posted by customers of the restaurant.
